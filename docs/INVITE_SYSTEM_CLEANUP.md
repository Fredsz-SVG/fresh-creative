# Invite System Cleanup - February 2026

## Summary
Removed deprecated `album_invites` table system. Admin/member management now works through **role promotion** of existing members, not through invite links or email input.

## What Changed

### ❌ Old System (DEPRECATED)
- **Method**: Generate invite token → Send link → User clicks → Join album
- **Table**: `album_invites` (token, expires_at, role)
- **Routes**: 
  - POST `/api/albums/[id]/invite` (create token)
  - POST `/api/albums/invite/[token]/join` (accept invite)
- **UI**: Generate invite link button

### ✅ New System (CURRENT)
- **Method**: Member joins → Owner promotes to admin
- **Flow**:
  1. User registers via student invite link
  2. Owner approves registration → User becomes member
  3. Owner can promote member to admin via "Jadikan Admin" button
  4. Or demote admin to member via "Hapus Admin" button
- **Table**: `album_members` (role updated via PATCH)
- **Route**: PATCH `/api/albums/[id]/members` (role update only)
- **UI**: List all members with promote/demote buttons in Team sidebar

## Two Separate Systems

| Feature | Admin/Member Management | Student Registration |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Status** | ✅ Active (Role Promotion) | ✅ Active (Token) |
| **Storage** | `album_members.role` | `albums.student_invite_token` |
| **UI Location** | Team Sidebar → List + Buttons | Access Sidebar → Generate Link |
| **Target** | Promote existing members | New yearbook students |
| **Flow** | Member → Promote → Admin | Token → Register → Approve → Member |

## Migration Steps

\i supabase/migrations/21_add_student_invite_token.sql
```

\i supabase/migrations/22_cleanup_deprecated_album_invites.sql
```

## API Endpoints Status

### 🔴 Deprecated (Can be deleted)
- POST `/api/albums/[id]/invite` (create admin/member invite token)
- POST `/api/albums/invite/[token]/join` (join via invite token)
- POST `/api/albums/[id]/members` with email (add by email - unused in UI)

### 🟢 Active
- PATCH `/api/albums/[id]/members` (update member role - promote/demote)
- GET/POST `/api/albums/[id]/invite-token` (student invites)
- GET `/api/albums/invite/[token]` (validate student invite)

## Testing Checklist

## Support

For questions about the new system:
1. **Making Someone Admin**: Wait for them to register → Approve → Click "Jadikan Admin" in Team sidebar
2. **Student Registration**: Generate link in Access sidebar, share with students
3. **Managing Team**: View all members in Team sidebar, promote/demote/remove as needed
